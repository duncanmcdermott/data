# Hardware Store Final Project

For a school assignment, I was tasked with designing a database for a small business to help organize sales and customer data. The project involved creating a database utilizing CSV files containing product, state, zip code, and sales data. Additionally, I had to create a unique cust_id for customers based on their name and address, and group purchases into invoices by assigning a unique invoice_id for transactions on the same day/time.

This project simulates a real-time data feed and aims to streamline customer and sales management.
