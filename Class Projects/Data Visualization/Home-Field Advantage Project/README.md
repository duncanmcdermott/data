# Home-Field Advantage Analysis


**By Duncan McDermott, Jack Phillips, and Reed Interdonato**

The goal of this project was to look into whether a "home-field advantage" is an actual relevant advantage in professional sports. Where a professional sports game is played is often given a lot of attention. In college football, intra-conference away games for a superior opponent are often called "trap-games", as in what should be an easy win could instead be a trap. In the NFL, teams playing out of cold cities, like the Buffalo Bills and Minnesota Vikings, are often said to have a greater home-field advantage during winter games. Most significantly, in almost every single professional sports league playoff system, the team with the better record and better seeding in said playoffs is often given home-field advantage. Our project aimed to explore whether home teams often won more than away teams.

Python Notebooks used to analyze the data and create visualizations are broken into each professional sports league we analyzed and can be found in this folder.
